# The Next Steps

- Learning JavaScript will help you ***manipulate the DOM*** to gain the target's information, ***creating a keylogger*** script will log the keystrokes so that you can access the user's information with those keys pressed, and you can use web development knowledge to completely ***mirror a web application*** and trick the user into inputting their information. 

- JavaScript is just a language, but when combined with certain techniques and tools, you can do some unbelievably devastating things to a target machine.

- JavaScript is really important in the world of Cybersecurity, especially when it comes to ***web application exploitation***, ***cross-site scripting***, ***JavaScript injection***, and many more methods.
