# JavaScript Arrays

- Arrays are fairly similar to objects, they have different stored values and syntax, but can be used for almost anything.

- Here is the same code as objects but in an array:
```
var choosePill = ['Red', 'Blue', 2];

var choice = choosePill[0];

console.log(choice); // Outputs 'Red'
```

#

**Reminder: Most programming languages start from 0, not 1, so when we access the `choosePill` variable, we grab the value from the `1st` position**.

- Arrays are extremely important when ***storing multiple values*** within a variable. 
- This way we don't have to write 100 variables and instead can store them all in a single variable, this is an array. 
- There are multiple ways to write an array, but [this one](https://github.com/ShubhamJagtap2000/JavaScript-Basics/blob/main/08%20Arrays/Examples/array.js) is simplest and most basic version is the example above.
