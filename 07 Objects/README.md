# JavaScript Objects

- The most important thing about objects is to remember that they're just another variation of variables. 

- Here is a quick example of an object:
```
var choosePill = {
    pillOne: 'Red',
    pillTwo: 'Blue'
}
```

#

- Here's a table displaying the code object we just wrote:

|Property	|Stored Value|
|--|---|
|pillOne	|Red|
|pillTwo	|Blue|

- Even though we only stored strings (you can remember strings based on the quotations), we can also store numbers. Here is our same code, updated:
```
var choosePill = {
    pillOne: 'Red',
    pillTwo: 'Blue',
    numberOfPills: 2
}
var choice = choosePill.pillOne; // This will access the Objects property
```

|Property|	Stored Value|
|--|--|
|pillOne	|Red|
|pillTwo	|Blue|
|numberOfPills|	2|
