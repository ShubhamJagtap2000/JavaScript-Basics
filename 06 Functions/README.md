# JavaScript Functions

- Functions are one of the most vital parts of programming. Due to how important functions are, there will be a lot of things we don't cover, but remember that functions are going to be vital to any applications you write.

- **ECMAScript 6** is the most popular version of JavaScript. There are a lot of important differences between ES5 and ES6, we focus mainly on ES6 in this repo.

- [This](https://github.com/ShubhamJagtap2000/JavaScript-Basics/blob/main/06%20Functions/Examples/ES6-function.js) is a function in `ES6`(ECMAScript 6):
```
const func = (a, b) => {

    let nums = a * b;

    console.log(nums); // Outputs 250

}

func(25, 10);
```

- [This](https://github.com/ShubhamJagtap2000/JavaScript-Basics/blob/main/06%20Functions/Examples/ES5-function.js) is a function in `ES5`(ECMAScript 5):
```
function func(a, b) // Everything inside of the parenthesis defines our parameter(s)

{

    let nums = a * b;

    console.log(nums); // Outputs 250

}

func(25, 10);
```

- A few things that make up a function are the parameter(s), variables, and our executed code. 

- Functions can contain if conditionals, defined variables, multiple parameters, and return statements. 
- Functions are usually the same across programming languages with minor syntax changes.
